#### Installation

Run `npm install` from the root directory as you normally might.

#### Running & development

`sudo gulp server` creates a simple web server. `sudo` is required for port 80 (looks a bit nicer), but feel free to change that yourself in `gulpfile.js`.

`gulp` builds JavaScript & CSS, then watches for future changes.
